### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm pursuing graduation. Apart from this, I'm interested to learn programming languages and become a full-stack developer. I'm outgoing and dedicated. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time.
